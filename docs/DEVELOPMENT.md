| `make validate-mustang` | Cross-check every fixture's hybrid PDF against the Mustang Project CLI: extract-and-diff, then validate the extracted XML |

## Code Style

**Prettier** for formatting, **ESLint** for linting (`.prettierrc`, `eslint.config.js`,
`.editorconfig`). Before committing:

```bash
npm run format && npm run lint
```

`npm run lint`
Example: unused variables, unsafe patterns, incorrect TypeScript/ESLint rules.

`npm run format`
Example: spacing, indentation, line breaks, quotes, trailing commas.

After changing the adapter or fixtures, regenerate XML output: `npm run build && make generate`.
The PDF/A-3 equivalent is `npm run build && make generate-pdf`; `make validate-pdf-attachment`
verifies the embedded XML matches `toXRechnung()`'s direct output for every fixture.

### TypeScript configuration

`tsconfig.json` can't hold comments, so the notable non-default options are documented here:

| Option                        | Value      | Purpose                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `module` / `moduleResolution` | `NodeNext` | Native ESM, matching `"type": "module"` in `package.json`                        |
| `strict`                      | `true`     | All strict type-checking options                                                 |
| `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`    | `true`     | Treats `arr[i]` as possibly `undefined`                                          |
| `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`  | `true`     | Distinguishes a missing optional property from one explicitly set to `undefined` |

Everything else is standard for a Node ESM library — see `tsconfig.json` directly.

### Dependency policy

Two runtime dependencies, both scoped to the hybrid PDF/A-3 adapter
(`adapters/hybrid-pdf.ts`/`adapters/hybrid-pdf-mapping.ts`):

- [`@cantoo/pdf-lib`](https://github.com/cantoo-scribe/pdf-lib) — PDF generation, ICC output
  intents, embedded-file attachment, and XMP metadata.
- [`fontkit`](https://github.com/foliojs/fontkit) — required by `@cantoo/pdf-lib` to embed custom
  (non-`StandardFonts`) TTF/OTF fonts via `PDFDocument.registerFontkit()`; not bundled by
  `@cantoo/pdf-lib` itself.

These cover PDF/A-3 conformance mechanics — font subsetting, color/ICC handling, embedded-file
attachment — that can't reasonably be hand-rolled the way XRechnung's XML serialization was.
Everything else stays `devDependencies` (build/lint/format/test). See
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md#no-runtime-dependencies) for why this is a scoped exception,
not a change in policy for the rest of the engine.

## How to Add a New Invoice Fixture

1. Create `fixtures/NN.<name>.invoice.json`, where `NN` is the next unused two-digit number. It
   must validate against `schemas/invoice.schema.json`.
2. Add it to `fixtures/index.ts`: a static `import ... with { type: "json" }`, an entry in the
   `export { ... }` list, and a numbered `[label, data]` entry in `allFixtures`. That single list
   drives the business-rules, XRechnung/CII/hybrid-PDF, KoSIT, veraPDF and Mustang regression
   tests, so nothing else needs editing. `fixtures/index.test.ts` fails if a `*.invoice.json`
   file and its `allFixtures` entry drift apart.
3. Run `npm test` to confirm everything passes.
4. Document the scenario in [`fixtures/README.md`](../fixtures/README.md).

**Naming convention:** `<scenario>.invoice.json` — e.g. `08.intra-eu-supply.invoice.json`.

---

## Commit Message Convention

Loosely [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `type: short description`.
`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore` cover most commits; `style`/`refactor`/`test`/`build`/`ci`/`perf`/
`revert` apply when they clearly fit. Not enforced by CI — a convention, not a hard requirement.

---

## How to Propose Changes

1. Fork the repo, branch from `main` with a descriptive name.
2. Keep commits focused — one logical change per commit.
3. Before pushing: `npm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test`.
4. Open a PR against `main` explaining what changed, why, and how it was tested.

## Reporting Issues

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/HongbaeKim/openinvoicexml/issues) — include expected vs.
actual behavior, steps to reproduce (ideally a triggering fixture JSON), and environment.
